		<h3>I&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Survive&nbsp;by Gloria&nbsp;Gaynor (1978)</h3>
	</header>
    <p>
        At first I was afraid, <span class="powerful">I was petrified</span><br>
        Thinking I could live without you by my side<br>
        And after spending nights<br>
        Thinking how you did me wrong<br>
        <span class="powerful">I grew strong</span><br>
        And I learned how to get along<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you're back<br>
        From outer space<br>
        And I find you here<br>
        With that sad look upon your face<br>
        I should've changed that stupid lock<br>
        Or made you leave your key<br>
        If I'd've known for a second<br>
        You'd be back to bother me<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="powerful">Go on, go, walk out the door</span><br>
        Turn around now<br>
        You're not welcome anymore<br>
        You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye<br>
        <span class="powerful">Think I'd crumble?</span><br>
        You think I'd lay down and die?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="powerful">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
        I've got my life to live<br>
        And all my love to give and<br>
        I will survive<br>
        <span class="powerful">I, I, I will survive</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        It took all my strength not to fall apart<br>
        Trying with all my might to mend my broken heart<br>
        I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself<br>
        How I cried<br>
        <span class="powerful">But now I hold my head up high</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And you see me, somebody new<br>
        I'm not that lonely little person<br>
        Still in love with you<br>
        Now you come droppin' in<br>
        Expectin' me to be free<br>
        Now I'm saving my lovin'<br>
        For someone who's loving me<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="powerful">Go on and go, walk out the door</span><br>
        Turn around now<br>
        You're not welcome anymore<br>
        You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye<br>
        <span class="powerful">Thinkin' I'd crumble</span><br>
        Did you think I'd lay down and die?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="powerful">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
        I've got my life to live, and all my love to give<br>
        And I will survive<br>
        <span class="powerful">I, I will survive</span><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="powerful">Go on, go, walk out the door</span><br>
        Turn around now<br>
        You're not welcome anymore<br>
        You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye<br>
        <span class="powerful">Think I'd crumble?</span><br>

    <p>
        <span class="powerful">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        Long as I know how to love<br>
        I know I'll stay alive<br>
        I've got my life to live<br>
        And all my love to give and<br>
        I will survive<br>
