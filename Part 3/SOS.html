		<h2>SOS by ABBA&nbsp;(1975)</h2>
	</header>
	<p>
		Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find<br>
		I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind<br>
		Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood<br>
		It used to be so nice, it used to be so good<br>
	</p>
	<p class = "chorus">
		So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<br>
		The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<br>
		When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<br>
		When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You seem so far away though you are standing near<br>
		You made me feel alive, but something died I fear<br>
		I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood<br>
		What happened to our love? It used to be so good<br>
	</p>
	<p class = "chorus">
		So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<br>
		The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<br>
		When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<br>
		When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<br>
	</p>
	<p class = "chorus">
		So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<br>
		And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<br>
		When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<br>
		When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<br>
		When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<br>
