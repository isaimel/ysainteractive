		<h3>Escape (The&nbsp;Piña&nbsp;Colada&nbsp;Song) by Rupert&nbsp;Holmes (1979)</h3>
	</header>
    <p>
        I was tired of my lady<br>
        We'd been together too long<br>
        Like a worn out recording<br>
        Of a favorite song<br>
        So while she lay there sleeping<br>
        I read the paper in bed<br>
        And in the personal columns<br>
        There was this letter I read<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you like piña coladas<br>
        And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
        If you're not into yoga<br>
        If you have half a brain<br>
        If you like making love at midnight<br>
        In the dunes on the cape<br>
        Then I'm the love that you've looked for<br>
        Write to me and escape<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't think about my lady<br>
        I know that sounds kind of mean<br>
        But me and my old lady<br>
        Had fallen into the same old dull routine<br>
        So I wrote to the paper<br>
        Took out a personal ad<br>
        And though I'm nobody's poet<br>
        I thought it wasn't half bad<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, I like piña coladas<br>
        And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
        I'm not much into health food<br>
        I am into champagne<br>
        I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon<br>
        And cut through all this red tape<br>
        At a bar called O'Malley's<br>
        Where we'll plan our escape<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        So I waited with high hopes<br>
        And she walked in the place<br>
        I knew her smile in an instant<br>
        I knew the curve of her face<br>
        It was my own lovely lady<br>
        And she said, "Aw, it's you"<br>
        Then we laughed for a moment<br>
        And I said, "I never knew"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        That you like piña coladas<br>
        And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
        And the feel of the ocean<br>
        And the taste of champagne<br>
        If you like making love at midnight<br>
        In the dunes on the cape<br>
        You're the lady I've looked for<br>
        Come with me and escape<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you like piña coladas<br>
        And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
        If you're not into yoga<br>
        If you have half a brain<br>
        If you like making love at midnight<br>
        In the dunes on the cape<br>
        Then I'm the love that you've looked for<br>
        Write to me and escape<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, I like piña coladas<br>
        And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
        I'm not much into health food<br>
        I am into champagne<br>
        I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon<br>
        And cut through all this red tape<br>
        At a bar called O'Malley's<br>
        Where we'll plan our escape<br>
