    <p>
        It would appear that popular songs provide a confusing picture of emotions, especially love and the feeling of being rejected. These difficulties are not limited to popular songs but occur equally in the larger society. Especially in English, conventional names for emotions can be ambiguous, confusing, and sometimes deceptive. In the spectrum of emotions, there may be no word for one feeling, too many for another, and one color can mean multiple things. Our emotion lexicon often conceals more than it reveals.
    </p>

    <p>
        This section will document the problems of emotion ideas in English, propose provisional new definitions for some basic emotions, and outline a theory of the social-emotional world. Using this framework, we can clarify how popular love songs both reveal and conceal emotions.
    </p>

    <p>
        People in modern societies assume progress is comprehensive, especially in technology and mastery of the outer world. Yet the realm of emotions seems less advanced, and the meanings of emotion words are often taken for granted. Proposing changes to these meanings may seem radical, but it is necessary to understand both songs and life.

    <p><strong>Three main defenses against emotions in Western society:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ignoring them:</strong> Most discussions omit emotions entirely, focusing instead on objects, behavior, beliefs, or attitudes. Even social sciences have only small enclaves devoted to emotions.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract mentions:</strong> When emotions are mentioned, it is often at such a general level that it dismisses their importance. Terms like <em>emotion</em>, <em>feeling</em>, <em>hurt</em>, <em>anxiety</em>, and <em>upset</em> are too broad to be meaningful.</li>
        <li><strong>Ambiguous words:</strong> Words that seem specific often mask other emotions. Later sections examine examples including fear/anxiety, anger, pride, shame, embarrassment, grief/sadness, and love.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Emotion words in English are so ambiguous that both laypeople and experts often disagree. For example, studies show no consensus on which emotions are basic. Some propose as few as two, others as many as eleven. No single word appears on all expert lists.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Pride:</strong> Can be positive or negative. Commonly interpreted negatively, it often masks genuine pride and may act as a defense against shame.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Fear / Anxiety:</strong> Originally, fear signaled physical danger, while anxiety was a lesser fear. Today, fear can mask shame or humiliation, and anxiety has become abstract, pliable, and diffuse.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Love:</strong> Encompasses almost any positive feeling, including dysfunctional attachment. It can conceal alienation and infatuation, which idealizes the other and hides flaws.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Grief / Sadness / Distress:</strong> Grief is often misunderstood and truncated in Western societies. Mourning is sometimes discouraged, even though extended grieving may be natural and necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Anger:</strong> Often confused with aggressive behavior. Feeling anger is an internal signal and can be instructive, while acting out anger reflects and generates disconnection.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Shame:</strong> Narrowly defined in English as extreme disgrace, distinct from embarrassment. Many other languages treat everyday shame as part of a continuum. For example, Spanish uses <em>verg√ºenza</em> for both shame and embarrassment; French distinguishes <em>honte</em> (disgrace) and <em>pudeur</em> (modesty/everyday shame).
    </p>

    <p>
        Emotion researchers also use inconsistent terminology. Words like <strong>distress</strong>, <strong>grief</strong>, and <strong>sadness</strong> are applied differently across studies, complicating cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary understanding.
