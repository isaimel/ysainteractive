        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes<br>
        Keep thinking, ah
        </p>
        <p>
        Last night I was taking a walk along the river<br>
        And I saw him together with a young girl<br>
        And the look that he gave her made me shiver<br>
        'Cause he always used to look at me that way<br>
        And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say<br>
        Ah ha ha, it's a game he likes to play
        </p>
        <p>
        Look into his angel eyes<br>
        One look and you're hypnotized<br>
        He'll take your heart and you must pay the price<br>
        Look into his angel eyes<br>
        You'll think you're in paradise<br>
        And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise<br>
        Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
        </p>
        <p>
        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes<br>
        I keep thinking, ah
        </p>
        <p>
        Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him<br>
        And it hurts to remember all the good times<br>
        When I thought I could never live without him<br>
        And I wonder does it have to be the same<br>
        Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?<br>
        Ah ha ha, how can I forget that name?
        </p>
        <p>
        Look into his angel eyes<br>
        One look and you're hypnotized<br>
        He'll take your heart and you must pay the price<br>
        Look into his angel eyes<br>
        You'll think you're in paradise<br>
        Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise<br>
        Don't look too deep into his angel eyes
        </p>
        <p>
        Crazy 'bout his angel eyes<br>
        Angel eyes<br>
        He took my heart and now I pay the price<br>
        Look into his angel eyes<br>
        You'll think you're in paradise<br>
        Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise<br>
        Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
        </p>
        <p>
        Oh no no no no<br>
        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Ah ha ha, keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
        </p>
        <p>
        Ah ha ha, I keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Keep thinking, had to pay the price<br>
        Ah ha ha, I keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>
        Keep thinking, 'bout his angel eyes<br>
        Ah ha ha, keep thinking, Ah ha ha, ha ha ha<br>

            I wasn't jealous before we met<br>
            Now every woman I see is a potential threat<br>
            And I'm possessive, it isn't nice<br>
            You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice<br>
            But now it isn't true<br>
            Now everything is new<br>
            And all I've learned has overturned<br>
            I beg of you<br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me
        </p>
        <p>
            It was like shooting a sitting duck<br>
            A little small talk, a smile, and baby I was stuck<br>
            I still don't know what you've done with me<br>
            A grown-up woman should never fall so easily<br>
            I feel a kind of fear<br>
            When I don't have you near<br>
            Unsatisfied, I skip my pride<br>
            I beg you, dear<br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me<br>
            Don't go sharing your devotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me

        <p>
            I've had a few little love affairs<br>
            They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce<br>
            I used to think I was sensible<br>
            It makes the truth even more incomprehensible<br>
            'Cause everything is new<br>
            And everything is you<br>
            And all I've learned has overturned<br>
            What can I do?<br>
            Don't go wasting your emotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me<br>
            Don't go sharing your devotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me

            Don't go sharing your devotion<br>
            Lay all your love on me<br>

            Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find<br>
            I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind<br>
            Whatever happened to our love?<br>

        So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)<br>

        How can anyone be so lonely?<br>
        Part of a success that never ends<br>
        Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)

        There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)<br>

        The loser has to fall<br>
        It's simple and it's plain<br>
        Why should I complain?
        </p>
        <p>
        But tell me does she kiss<br>
        Like I used to kiss you?<br>
        Does it feel the same<br>
        When she calls your name?<br>
        Somewhere deep inside<br>
        You must know I miss you<br>
        But what can I say?<br>
        Rules must be obeyed
        </p>
        <p>
        The judges will decide<br>
        The likes of me abide<br>
        Spectators of the show<br>
        Always staying low<br>
        The game is on again<br>
        A lover or a friend<br>
        A big thing or a small<br>
        The winner takes it all
        </p>
        <p>
        I don't wanna talk<br>
        If it makes you feel sad<br>
        And I understand<br>
        You've come to shake my hand<br>
        I apologize<br>
        If it makes you feel bad<br>
        Seeing me so tense<br>
        No self-confidence<br>
        But you see<br>
        The winner takes it all<br>
        The winner takes it all
        </p>
        <p>
        So the winner takes it all<br>
        And the loser has to fall<br>
        Throw a dice, cold as ice<br>
        Way down here, someone dear<br>
        Takes it all, has to fall<br>
        It seems plain to me
        </p>
