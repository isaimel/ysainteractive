        Elvis Presley ranks as my top artist; his voice, his originals, his covers, and the emotion poured into his work had broughout me to tears. They have helped me in my search for love, in my heartbreak, and in my growing confidence despite my vulnerabilities.<br><br>

        You fooled me with your kisses<br>

        I thought that I was in Heaven<br>

        The devil in your eyes

        I want to stay around you<br>
        And so I beg you let it be me<br>
        Don't take this heaven from one<br>
        If you must cling to someone<br>
        Now and forever let it be me

        Each time we meet, love<br>
        I find complete love<br>
        Without your sweet love what would life be?<br>
        So never leave me lonely<br>
        Tell me you love me only<br>
        And that you'll always let it be me

        I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain<br>
        Taking any comfort that I can<br>
        Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains<br>
        And lying in your lovin' arms again

        Singing somewhere in the lonely night<br>

        And lying in your lovin' arms again<br>
        I can almost feel your lovin' arms again

        Well, it's hard to be a gambler<br>
        Bettin' on the number<br>
        That changes ev'ry time<br>
        Well, you think you're gonna win<br>
        Think she's givin' in<br>
        A stranger's all you find<br>
        Yeah, it's hard to figure out<br>
        What she's all about<br>
        That she's a woman through and through<br>
        She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue,

        <p>
        Oh, Moody blue<br>
        Tell me am I gettin' through<br>
        I keep hangin' on<br>
        Try to learn the song<br>
        But I never do<br>
        Oh, Moody blue,<br>
        Tell me who I'm talkin' to<br>
        You're like the night and day<br>
        And it's hard to say<br>
        Which one is you.

        Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday,<br>
        When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday,<br>
        Into another day again<br>
        Her personality unwinds<br>
        Just like a ball of twine<br>
        On a spool that never ends<br>
        Just when I think I know her well<br>
        Her emotions reveal,<br>
        She's not the person that<br>
        I thought I knew<br>
        She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue,

        Just pretend I didn't go<br>
        When I walked away, I heard you say<br>
        If you need me, you know what to do<br>
        I knew it then, I'd be back again<br>
        Just pretend I'm right there with you

        It's funny but I can't recall<br>
        The things we said or why you're crying<br>

        I belong here by your side

        <p>
        Yes, I'll come flying to you, oh yes<br>

        And now the end is near<br>
        So I face the final curtain<br>
        My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
        I'll state my case of which I'm certain<br>
        I've lived a life that's full<br>
        I've traveled each and every highway<br>
        And more, much more than this<br>
        I did it my way

        <p>
        Regrets, I've had a few<br>
        But then again, too<br>
        Few to mention<br>
        I did what I had to do<br>
        And now the end is near<br>
        So I face the final curtain<br>
        My friend, I'll say it clear<br>
        I'll state my case of which I'm certain<br>

        Few to mention<br>
        I did what I had to do<br>
        And saw it through without exemption
        </p>
        <p>
        I planned each charted course<br>
        Each careful step along the byway<br>
        And more, much more than this<br>
        I did it my way
        </p>
        <p>
        Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
        When I bit off more than I could chew<br>
        But through it all when there was doubt<br>
        I ate it up and spit it out<br>
        I faced it all and I stood tall<br>
        And did it my way

        I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
        I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
        And now as tears subside<br>
        I find it all so amusing<br>
        To think I did all that<br>
        And may I say, not in a shy way<br>
        Oh, no, no not me<br>
        I did it my way
        </p>
        <p>
        For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
        If not himself, then he has naught<br>
        To say the words he truly feels<br>
        And not the words of one who kneels<br>
        The record shows I took the blows<br>
        And did it my way

        You give me strength to carry on<br>
        And you're always there to lend a hand<br>
        In everything I do<br>
        That's the wonder<br>
