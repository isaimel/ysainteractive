    <p>
      When no-one else can understand me<br>
      When everything I do is wrong<br>
      You give me hope and consolation<br>
      You give me strength to carry on <br><br>

      And you're always there to lend a hand<br>
      In everything I do<br>
      That's the wonder<br>
      The wonder of you <br><br>

      And when you smile the world is brighter<br>
      You touch my hand and I'm a king<br>
      Your kiss to me is worth a fortune<br>
      Your love for me is everything <br><br>

      I guess I'll never know the reason why<br>
      You love me as you do<br>
      That's the wonder<br>
      The wonder of you <br><br>

      I guess I'll never know the reason why<br>
      You love me as you do<br>
      That's the wonder<br>
