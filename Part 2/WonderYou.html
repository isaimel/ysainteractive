    <h2> <i><span style="color:blue;">The&nbsp;Wonder&nbsp;of&nbsp;You</i> by Elvis&nbsp;Presley (1970) </span></h2>

    When no-one else can understand me<br>
    When everything I do is wrong<br>
    You give me hope and consolation<br>
    You give me strength to carry on <br><br>

    And you're always there to lend a hand<br>
    In everything I do<br>
    That's the wonder<br>
    The wonder of you <br><br>

    And when you smile the world is brighter<br>
    You touch my hand and I'm a king<br>
    Your kiss to me is worth a fortune<br>
    Your love for me is everything <br><br>

    I guess I'll never know the reason why<br>
    You love me as you do<br>
    That's the wonder<br>
    The wonder of you <br><br>

    I guess I'll never know the reason why<br>
    You love me as you do<br>
    That's the wonder<br>
    The wonder of you <br><br>
