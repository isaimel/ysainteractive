		"I know no one expects much from me! And I know better than anyone how useless a C Class hero is! I know I'm too weak even for B Class! I know more than anyone else that I'll never beat you! But I must fight you anyway! I'm the only one left! It's not about winning or losing! I just have to stand here and face you!"- Mumen Rider
