			<h2>SOS by ABBA&nbsp;(1975)</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find<hr>
			I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind<hr>
			Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood<hr>
			It used to be so nice, it used to be so good<hr>
		</p>
		<p class = "chorus">
			So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<hr>
			The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<hr>
			When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<hr>
			When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<hr>
		</p>
		<p>
			You seem so far away though you are standing near<hr>
			You made me feel alive, but something died I fear<hr>
			I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood<hr>
			What happened to our love? It used to be so good<hr>
		</p>
		<p class = "chorus">
			So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<hr>
			The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<hr>
			When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<hr>
			When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<hr>

			So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.<hr>
			And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.<hr>
			When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?<hr>
			When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?<hr>
