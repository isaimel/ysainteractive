		<h2>I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor (1978)</h2>
	</header>
    <p class="firstParagraph">
        <span class="iTalk">At first I was afraid, I was petrified</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Thinking I could live without you by my side</span><br>
        And after spending nights<br>
        <span class="youTalk">Thinking how you did me wrong</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">I grew strong</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">And I learned how to get along</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="youTalk">Now you're back</span><br>
        From outer space<br>
        <span class="iTalk">And I find you here</span><br>
        With that sad look upon your face<br>
        <span class="iTalk">I should've changed that stupid lock</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">Or made you leave your key</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">If I'd've known for a second</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">You'd be back to bother me</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Go on, go, walk out the door<br>
        Turn around now<br>
        <span class="youTalk">You're not welcome anymore</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Think I'd crumble?</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">You think I'd lay down and die?</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="iTalk">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">I've got my life to live</span><br>
        And all my love to give and<br>
        <span class="iTalk">I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">I, I, I will survive</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="iTalk">It took all my strength not to fall apart</span><br>
        Trying with all my might to mend my broken heart<br>
        <span class="iTalk">I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">How I cried</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">But now I hold my head up high</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="youTalk">And you see me, somebody new</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">I'm not that lonely little person</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">Still in love with you</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">Now you come droppin' in</span><br>
        Expectin' me to be free<br>
        <span class="iTalk">Now I'm saving my lovin'</span><br>
        For someone who's loving me<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Go on and go, walk out the door<br>
        Turn around now<br>
        <span class="youTalk">You're not welcome anymore</span><br>
        <span class="youTalk">You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Thinkin' I'd crumble</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Did you think I'd lay down and die?</span><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="iTalk">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">I've got my life to live, and all my love to give</span><br>
        <span class="iTalk">And I will survive</span><br>
