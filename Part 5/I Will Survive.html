    <p>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">At first I was afraid, I was petrified</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Thinking I could live without you by my side</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">And after spending nights</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">Thinking how you did me wrong</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I grew strong</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">And I learned how to get along</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">Now you're back</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">From outer space</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">And I find you here</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">With that sad look upon your face</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I should've changed that stupid lock</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">Or made you leave your key</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">If I'd've known for a second</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">You'd be back to bother me</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Go on, go, walk out the door</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Turn around now</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">You're not welcome anymore</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Think I'd crumble?</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">You think I'd lay down and die?</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I've got my life to live</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">And all my love to give and</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I, I, I will survive</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">It took all my strength not to fall apart</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Trying with all my might to mend my broken heart</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I spent so many nights feeling sorry for myself</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">How I cried</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">But now I hold my head up high</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">And you see me, somebody new</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I'm not that lonely little person</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">Still in love with you</span><br>
        <span class="collapse uTalk">Now you come droppin' in</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Expectin' me to be free</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Now I'm saving my lovin'</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">For someone who's loving me</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Go on and go, walk out the door</span><br>
        <span class="collapse nTalk">Turn around now</span><br>

        <span class="collapse iTalk">Thinkin' I'd crumble</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Did you think I'd lay down and die?</span><br>
<br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">No, not I, I will survive</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive</span><br>
        <span class="collapse iTalk">I've got my life to live, and all my love to give</span><br>
