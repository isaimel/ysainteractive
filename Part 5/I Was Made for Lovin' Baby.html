            Tonight<br>
            I wanna give it all to you<br>
            In the darkness<br>
            There's so much I wanna do<br>
            And tonight<br>
            I wanna lay it at your feet<br>
            'Cause, girl, I was made for you<br>
            And, girl, you were made for me<br>

            I was made for lovin' you, baby<br>
            You were made for lovin' me<br>
            And I can't get enough of you, baby<br>
            Can you get enough of me?<br>

            Feel the magic<br>
            There's something that drives me wild<br>
            And tonight<br>
            We're gonna make it all come true<br>
