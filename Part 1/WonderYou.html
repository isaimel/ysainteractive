The&nbsp;Wonder&nbsp;of&nbsp;You by Elvis&nbsp;Presley (1970) <br><br>

When no-one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on <br><br>

And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you <br><br>

And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything <br><br>

I guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you <br><br>

I guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you
